              <h1>Sydney Opera house</h1>

                The Sydney Opera House is a multi-venue performing arts centre
                 in Sydney, Australia. Located on the foreshore of Sydney Harbour, 
                 it is widely regarded as one of the world's most famous and distinctive 
                 buildings and a masterpiece of 20th-century architecture.Designed by 
                 Danish architect JÃ¸rn Utzon, but completed by an Australian 
                 architectural team headed by Peter Hall, the building was formally 
                 opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 October 1973 after a gestation 
                 beginning with Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international 
                 design competition. The Government of New South Wales, led by the 
                 premier, Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon 
                 directing construction.
